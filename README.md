This project was inspired from a my previous fightstick project, which used the tiva c tm4c123 
https://github.com/SnrNotHere16/ArcadeStickWithScreen
My motivation was to create a fightstick that I could be fighitng games like street fighter. 
Although my fight stick worked perfectly on emulators, it did not register properly on steam. 
Because I could not get the fightstick to work, I figured that if I created an hid keyboard 
device then steam should be able to register the commands properly.

Here is an image of the keys assigned to each button though I may change this in the future.
